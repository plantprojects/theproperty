							and Benjamin Bergery to take place the nights of December 12th, 13th and 14th, from 6pm to 11pm.</p>
						<p><i>On Broadway</i> is a presentation of projected, lit and amplified works housed in each of the storefronts of the 440 Broadway arcade mezzanine.  The experience being somewhere between browsing a rambling museum and window shopping, viewers can glimpse each work through a glass wall and choose to enter each store-cum-gallery space to take a closer look and hear the artworks corresponding audio.</p>
						<p>The exhibition is free and open to the public and there is $5.50 parking available above the venue, cash only, with a performance by TBD to take place on Friday December 12th at 8pm.</p>

				<i>Glimpse</i>, 2007<br/>
				Video Projector, DVD Player, slide projector, blank slides, custom electronics.
			</div>
			
			<div class="artwork">
				<p>A slide projector and a video projector point to the same spot on a wall. The superimposed projections from the two formats cause the video projection of found home movies to be washed out and nearly indecipherable. Every time a new image or edit point occurs in the video stream, the slide projector moves to the next slide so only the first second of every new camera shot from the home movies is visible.</p>				
			</div>
			
			<blockquote>
				About 5 years ago I started making works that incorporated found home movie footage in a liminal way.  As the movies were presented in extremely low resolution, none of the details of the images were visible to the viewers giving them a somewhat "universal" home movie feel. Glimpse, which also uses found home movies, presents the films obscured/washed out by the light of a slide projector such that only the beginning of each camera shot is visible.  This structure makes Glimpse liminal in a different perceptual dimension compared to my other home movie based works.   One needs to use short term memory and edge recognition to comprehend the moving imagery of Glimpse.

				<i>Not West of Western</i>, 2011<br/>
				16mm, b/w, sound, 13.5 min
			</div>
			
			<div class="artwork">
				<p>Walking within parameters that define the heart of Los Angeles, <i>Not West of Western</i> explores the cross section of still photography and cinema
					while at the same time calling attention to the unique cross-cultural landscape of the city.
					The short will be shown on film with a 16mm looping projector, mixing the hum of mechanical projection with the film's ambient soundtrack of the Los Angeles landscape. Dean highlights the pedestrian's view of the city's center, pausing on neighborhood scenes before blinking and traveling on to the next tableau.  Not West of Western is an honest view of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles that just woke up and forgot to put on its make-up, or maybe even its pants.</p>

				<p>Clay Dean is a visual artist who takes a methodological and metaphysical approach toward the understanding of material and environment. This results in images and objects that are born from process and an exploration of the formal qualities of medium. His most recent work looks at the intersection of the still and moving image by re-contextualizing the remnants of urban spaces. His work has been shown at Film Forum (Los Angeles), Dhaka International Film Festival (Bangladesh), STARZ Film Center (Denver), Museum of Contemporary Art (Los Angeles), and most recently a solo exhibition at WEEKEND Gallery (Los Angeles). Clay Dean lives and works in Los Angeles, California.</p>

				<i>Many small people</i>, 2014<br/>
				A recording composition as an audio diary.<br/>
				Footage: East side gallery, Berlin, Deutschland (21.6.2014 ) & 7.1 Demonstration on the street (1.7.2014), Hong Kong
			</div>
			
			<div class="artwork">
				<p><i>Many small people</i> is a sound piece comprised of audio collected from protest events in Hong Kong and the site of the former Berlin wall in Germany, superimposed on one another, bringing the audience to an unrealistic place representing the artist's imagination. After the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997,  the democracy and freedom formerly experienced by its citizens has been challenged by the Chinese Communists through excessive assimilation. By superimposing the ambient sounds of Berlin, which Fung believes its history is similar to current Hong Kong, <i>Many small people </i>hints at what the artist is yearning for in post-colonial Hong Kong.</p>

				<p>Jasper Fung (b.1988), is a Hong Kong based artist and keyboardist. His work intertwines installation, music and sonic composition that significantly arouse introspection into today's discourteous and coarse world alongside the rapid elimination of social interactiveness. Fung's work explores the terrain over classical, alternative, sound and space, rooted in his determination to challenge any models of traditional discipline.</p>
				<p>In 2012, Fung received his Bachelor Degree in School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong. He finished his first exhibition, "Discordia", 10 Chancery Lane Gallery with various Hong Kong young artists. in the same year, Fung co-organized the project DIODE, a platform to explore the unique experiences in sound art performance. In June 2014, Fung is invited to Goldesmiths, University of London for the international conference for New Interfaces Musical Expression.</p>

				<p>Sterner's sculptural video installations present the experience of moving through an everyday landscape as seen through a lens, veil and possibly yet another screen, so the viewer is engulfed in a familiar landscape, but twice or three times removed, to create a meta, almost ghost-like experience where the landscape is real and the viewer is the apparition.</p>

				<p>Theresa Sterner (b. 1985) was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado and grew up in Oregon.  She received her BFA from the University of Oregon and her MFA in Sculpture from Tyler School of Art.  Based in Brooklyn, New York, she makes sculpture and video that explores perception and landscape through physical casts and digital impressions.</p>
